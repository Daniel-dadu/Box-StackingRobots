# 3D Simulation of Box-Stacking Robots

This project, developed during my bachelor's degree, aimed to provide me with insights into the functioning of multi-agent systems and their representation through an engaging 3D object simulation.

The frontend was created using Unity and 3D objects, including robots, boxes, shelves, and the background. On the backend, an application was developed using the Agent-based modeling framework Mesa, complemented by a Flask-based API.

For a comprehensive understanding of each project component and a live demonstration of the simulation, please refer to the explanatory video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B50ad7ZO-80](https://youtu.be/B50ad7ZO-80)
